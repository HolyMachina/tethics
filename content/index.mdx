# Welcome to Tethics

This blog will be focusing on ethics, technology, and the intersection between them.

The first two things I'm seeking to answer are:

* What are ethics?
* What is technology?

As we dig into these things they'll be deeply connected to the *humanity* around us.

Humans are messy and complicated for various reasons, but that's going to mean we cannot avoid the topics of *values* and *laws*.

This means we'll also have to dig into the method values get formed (identity) and how laws get formed (politics).

I promise this website will never have a pledge for you to sign. (I've never seen Silicon Valley)
