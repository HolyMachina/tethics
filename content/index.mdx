# Welcome to Tethics

This blog will be focusing on ethics, technology, and the intersection between them.

The first two things I'm seeking to answer are:

* What are ethics?
* What is technology?

Over time, I intend to investigate:

* Various historical technological inventions and were they ethical?
* What causes various technologies to be adopted?
* Is technology inherently a benefit or determent to humanity?
* What *really* drives technology forward?
* How do we come to shared ideas of ethics?
* Why do people disagree about what is ethical?
* Why are some people inherently resistant to new technologies?
* What's the story with early adopters why are they so into tech?
* Why do some brands seem to have these super loyal devotees?

All of these questions can be answered by exploring this interaction between ethics and technology.  
If these questions interest you like they interest me, explore them with me over... well... the rest of my life.

I promise this website will never have a pledge for you to sign.
